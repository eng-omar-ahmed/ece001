  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">A computer program is a programming code that is executed on a computer processor. The code can be a device level icon, or a written OS icon. An operating system is a program that aims to provide a predictable and reliable layer for other programmers to build other programs on it, known as applications. It also provides a reliable layer for device manufacturers. This standardization creates an effective environment for programmers to create smaller programs, which can be run by millions of computers. The program can also be considered as an expression that contrasts hardware. The computer's hardware components are hardware; Digital programs that run on devices are programs. The software can also be updated or replaced much easier than on hardware. In addition, the program can be distributed to a number of device receivers. Basically, the program is the interaction of computer users with computer logic</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">The system software is responsible for controlling, integrating and managing the individual hardware components of the computer system, so that the other program and system users see it as a functional unit without needing to pay attention to low-level details such as transferring data from memory to disk, or displaying text on the screen. In general, system software consists of an operating system and some basic utilities such as disk formatting tools, file managers, display managers, text editors, user authentication (login), administration and networking tools, and device control software.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">On the other hand, application programs are used to accomplish specific tasks other than just operating a computer system. Application programs may consist of one program, such as Photo Viewer; A small set of programs (often called a software bundle) that work closely together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet or a word processing system; A larger group (often called a program group) of related and standalone programs and packages that have a common user interface or shared data format, such as Microsoft Office, which consists of an integrated word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc; Or a software system, such as a database management system, which is a set of basic programs that may provide some services to a variety of other independent applications.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">The software is created using programming languages and related utilities, which may come in many of the above models: individual programs such as script interpreters, packages containing translator, link, and other tools; And large suites (often called integrated development environments) that include editors, debuggers, and other tools for multiple languages.</p></li>

 <u><h2 style="color:blue;">Intangible components are called programs, and they are divided into this form:</h2></u>
 <ul>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">System software:<small>(Windows and DOS programe,Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Android and various Linux distributions)</small></p></li>
