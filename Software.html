  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Computer software is programming code executed on a computer processor. The code can be machine-level code, or code written for an operating system. An operating system is software intended to provide a predictable and dependable layer for other programmers to build other software on, which are known as applications. It also provides a dependable layer for hardware manufacturers. This standardization creates an efficient environment for programmers to create smaller programs, which can be run by millions of computers. Software can also be thought of as an expression that contrasts with hardware. The physical components of a computer are the hardware; the digital programs running on the hardware are the software. Software can also be updated or replaced much easier than hardware. Additionally, software can be distributed to a number of hardware receivers. Basically, software is the computer logic computer users interact with.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">System software is responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system so that other software and the users of the system see it as a functional unit without having to be concerned with the low-level details such as transferring data from memory to disk, or rendering text onto a display. Generally, system software consists of an operating system and some fundamental utilities such as disk formatters, file managers, display managers, text editors, user authentication (login) and management tools, and networking and device control software.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Application software, on the other hand, is used to accomplish specific tasks other than just running the computer system. Application software may consist of a single program, such as an image viewer; a small collection of programs (often called a software package) that work closely together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet or text processing system; a larger collection (often called a software suite) of related but independent programs and packages that have a common user interface or shared data format, such as Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software system, such as a database management system, which is a collection of fundamental programs that may provide some service to a variety of other independent applications.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Software is created with programming languages and related utilities, which may come in several of the above forms: single programs like script interpreters, packages containing a compiler, linker, and other tools; and large suites (often called Integrated Development Environments) that include editors, debuggers, and other tools for multiple languages.</p></li>

 <u><h2 style="color:blue;">Intangible components are called programs, and they are divided into this form:</h2></u>
