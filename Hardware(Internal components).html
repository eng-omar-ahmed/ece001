 <p style="font-size:110%;">The system unit is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor, which acts as the "brain" of your computer. Another component is random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off.

Almost every other part of your computer connects to the system unit using cables. The cables plug into specific ports (openings), typically on the back of the system unit. Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a peripheral device. Peripheral devices can be external such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner or internal, such as a CD-ROM drive, CD-R drive or internal modem. Internal peripheral devices are often referred to as integrated peripherals</p>
 <p style="font-size:110%;">Internal components is called the system unit, and it includes many important parts of the computer, the most important of them:</p>
 <h3 style="color:red;">1-motherboard (mainboard, system board, planar board or logic board):</h3>
 <p style="font-size:110%;">is the main printed circuit board found in computers and other expandable systems. It holds many of the crucial electronic components of the system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.</p>
 <h3 style="color:red;">2-Central processing unit(CPU):</h3>
 <p style="font-size:110%;">The central processing unit, or what is known as the processor, is considered as the brain of the computer. Computer, the more sophisticated the technical specifications of the processor, this leads to the speedy execution of orders and processing them,and The CPU consists of several parts, such as the unit of calculation and logic (ALU) that is tasked with performing the calculations and logical operations that the processor needs, and the control unit (CU) that manages the other components of the device, in addition to the cache in which the commands are copied and placed in it To be called when it is needed, it is considered a high-speed memory type.</p>
 <u><b><p style="font-size:120%;color:violet">Is the brain or the heart of a computer. Is also known as processor and consist of three units namely:</p></b></u>
<ul>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Control Unit ( C U).</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Arithmetic logic Unit ( A L U).</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Main Memory unit ( M M U).</p></li>
</ul>
<u><b><p style="font-size:120%;color:violet">TYPES OF PROCESSORS:</p></b></u>
<ul>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Comples Instruction Set Computers (CISC).</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC).</p></li>
</ul>
 <u><b><p style="font-size:120%;color:violet">FUNCTIONS OF CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT:</p></b></u>
 <ol>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Process data.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">Control sequence of operaions within the computers.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">It gives command to all parts of a computer.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">It control the use of the main memory in storing of data and instructions.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-size:110%;">it provides temporary storage (RAM) and permanent storage(ROM) of data.</p></li>
</ol>
  <h3 style="color:red;">3-Random access memory(RAM):</h3>
  <p style="font-size:110%;">RAM is defined as memory units made up of a large number of transistors and capacitors, and installed on the motherboard of a computer, and RAM is volatile memory, meaning that its contents disappear when the device is turned off, it is a temporary storage location, through which a unit is supplied Central processing with the information you need in a very fast time of up to a few parts per million per second, and this memory is divided into two types: dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM).</p>

  <h3 style="color:red;">4-power supply:</h3>
  <p style="font-size:110%;">The power supply is the part responsible for converting the alternating current into a low-voltage constant current in proportion to the contents in the computer, and the power supply generates varying amounts of voltage, which are -5, +5, 3.3, and 12 volts, as assigned The task of supplying the components of the computer with electrical power, including the motherboard, and the power supply is often located in the upper or lower back of the computer, and it should be noted that opening this part should be avoided even if the device is turned off due to the strong electrical charges it may contain It may be stored in capacitors.</p>
  <h3 style="color:red;">5-Hard Disk:</h3>
  <p style="font-size:110%;">The hard disk is defined as a computer component that allows storing large amounts of data on it that may reach hundreds of gigabytes, and this part of the computer is referred to as HDD, and the hard disk memory is considered a fixed memory, i.e. its contents do not go away with a power outage from it, this magnetic disk It stores data through magnetic rotating disks, and there are many different types of hard disks that range in size and speed, so the speed of the hard disk depends on the number of revolutions it performs during one minute. Lara B SSD faster types of hard disks.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">6-Screen card:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:110%;">A video card or video card is defined as the component that sends graphics data to a visual output device such as a monitor, monitor, or even a TV, and the video card is installed on the motherboard so that it has multiple external ports such as HDMI, VGA, or DVI, and it should be noted that Each motherboard on a computer is compatible with specific types of screen cards that can be attached to it.</p>
      <h3 style="color:red;">7-Port:</h3>
      <p style="font-size:110%;">is a place through which peripheral devices are attached to computer so that data can be exchanged between it and the operating system.</p>
      <h3 style="color:red;">8-Floppy disk drive:</h3>
      <p style="font-size:110%;">It is based on reading and storing information to and from the floppy disk.</p>
      <h3 style="color:red;">9-CD rom:</h3>
       <p style="font-size:110%;">which are of several types, including: read-only laser CD roms, writing and reading laser drives, and digital type writing and reading CD roms.</p>
